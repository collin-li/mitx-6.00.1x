This repository contains Python code developed throughout the course of 6.00.1x taken through MITx

There will be individual files per problem in each problem set. For example, Problem Set 1 has 3 problems, thus you will find the files:
* ps1-1.py
* ps1-2.py
* ps1-3.py

The details of the problem being solved will be stated in the comments of the code

Problems that I found interesting and not completely trivial (completely subjective):
* ps1-3.py
* More to come...
